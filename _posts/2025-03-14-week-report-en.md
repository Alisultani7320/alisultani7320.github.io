# Weekly Report

## Introduction

The past week was busy and productive. In this report, I would like to share my achievements, challenges, and plans for the future.

## Academic Activities

This week I attended all scheduled lectures and seminars for the following subjects:
- Mathematical Analysis
- Algebra and Geometry
- Programming
- English Language
- History

The lecture on mathematical analysis was particularly interesting, where we started studying a new topic - "Integral Calculus". The professor explained the basic concepts very clearly and provided several practical examples.

## Completed Assignments

During the past week, I completed the following tasks:
1. Prepared a report on the history of "Development of Mathematics in the Ancient World"
2. Solved all problems in mathematical analysis
3. Completed the laboratory work on programming
4. Prepared for the English language test

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge this week was time management. Due to the large number of assignments, it was difficult to allocate time effectively. I solved this problem by creating a detailed plan for each day and strictly adhering to it.

## Plans for Next Week

For the next week, I plan to:
1. Prepare for the algebra test
2. Start working on a new programming project
3. Improve my skills in solving integrals
4. Attend an English language consultation

## Conclusion

Overall, the past week was successful. I learned a lot and completed all the tasks set. I hope that the next week will be equally productive.
